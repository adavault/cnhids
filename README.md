# cnhids
cnhids is a Host Intrusion Detection System for cardano node based on OSSEC:

- cnHids aims to provide an easy way to monitor and analyse OSSEC data by feeding into Prometheus and Grafana to make a simple SIEM.
- Some customisation of OSSEC agents provide better monitoring for the GuildOps cnTools standard directory structure.
- Selected files are in this repo. The installation process has not been scripted yet and is very manual.
